## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## My Thoughts

My initial thoughts to the test was that it would be pretty basic and trivial based on thinking I would just be displaying a list. After displaying the list using NgRx it taught me how complex and detailed the store management system can be, just the many different steps it would take to retrieve the data, to be able to filter and manipulate it.

## Comments

This technical test had little detail but at the same time I felt like I had more freedom to implement things the way I wanted utilizing the different tools that were suggested to me such NgRx and Angular Materil. This enabled me to quickly bring about an application which displays in brief my skills as a developer and the knack I have to be able to learn and pick up new technologies and adapt to existing ones at a rapid pace.

## Challenges / Successes

I didn't know much at all about NgRx this past Thursday. I had an interview on Friday, was given a test and took a crash course in NgRx and brought my self up to speed, and I can say I was missing out on a lot of different functionalities and capabilities that can be utilized from it. So doing the test I had a lot to learn and adjust to from the different functionality such as using NgRx to retrieve data and filter it. I also learnt how to test components which have a Store and how to mock it. That was my biggest challenge and success together.
